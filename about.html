        <h2 class="article-title"> My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>

        <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat. </strong>I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
          
        <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
          
        <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
        
        <p><strong> was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
        
        <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
        
        <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
        
        <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong> felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, </strong>and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
